      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a cloud ops engineer with a passion for security and self-hosting. I generally practice a lot of offensive security due to the ease of jumping into HackTheBox. A lot of times I can use this knowledge to help build better security practices during my time as an ops engineer.
I hope to use this blog to keep a log of HackTheBox machines I find interesting and talking about the side projects I decide to take on.</description>

      <description>Blunder is a hilariously memorable box because of the simplicity behind exploiting CVE-2019-14287, a sudo version vulnerability, to gain root access. It starts out with a simple blog using the Bludit CMS. We find a version number that happens to be vulnerable to bypassing anti-brute force measures.
 Recon Nmap We always start with our standard nmap scan. I typically immediately go to the script and version detection scan across all ports.</description>
